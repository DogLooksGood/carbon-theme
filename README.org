#+title: Carbon Theme

* Intro

This theme prioritizes simplicity in design.

It highlights only static information, which, in my opinion,
makes code easier to read. Too many colors can be distracting
and are not ideal for everyday programming.

All colors have similar contrast, ensuring no part of the text
is overly stressed or ignored. Comments should be considered
as important as the code itself.

Unlike many modern themes, this theme avoids a bluish tint,
as that can be stressful on the eyes.
